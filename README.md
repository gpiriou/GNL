# Get Next Line

42Paris school project.

Implement a function that reads a file and stores the content in a buffer until a newline character is found. Buffer sizes may vary and multiple fd's may be opened.

Due to the project rules and limitations (only two files and a maximum of 5 functions per file) the code is more intricate than it should / could have been.
